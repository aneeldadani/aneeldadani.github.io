My name is Aneel Dadani. I am a Senior Manager of our Security Technical Account Management team at Fastly. We do awesome things like defending companies from nefarious actors.

### My story

I started my journey working at McDonald's when I was 14 to selling shoes and clothes at department stores, Old Navy, and even helping my family run their jewelery business. During college I was an IT intern at multiple Fortune 500 companies. After college I became an Information Security Administrator. I've been in Cybersecurity ever since. I'm always looking for ways to break things and make it better.
