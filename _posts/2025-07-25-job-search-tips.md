# Job Search Tips

Recently, I was on the job market. I was fortunate enough to be able to transition from one role to another without experiencing some of the challenges a lot of applicants are dealing with in this current job market. I want to help those who are on the job market because I have been on the other side of the interview process, interviewing candidates, and evaluating talent for my team(s) at my current and former employers. Some of these tips are basic, but I am seeing people struggle with this, and I really want to help people.

## 1. Leverage Your Network

Everyone you meet, everyone you talk to in your life, whether it's at work or somewhere else, build your network. This takes time and patience. I'll admit, I'm bad at staying in touch with people, but do your best to maintain positive, professional relationships. You never know when someone may come back and work with you or for you. When you have positive relationships with people, they will remember that and later be your opportunity to get your foot in the door.

## 2. Understand the Specific Role You Are Seeking

I know this is easier said than done because of the way the job market is right now. Target the role you're looking for, make sure it aligns with the skills you have. Make sure your resume explains your experience and aligns with the role you're applying for.

## 3. Take Rejection with a Grain of Salt

Not everyone is going to love you. The rejection emails can hit hard sometimes, especially if it was for a role you were looking forward to. Stay in the moment, don't get ahead of yourself. If you're interviewing with the hiring manager or someone at the company and that leads to a rejection, it wasn't a fit. They didn't see your potential, and that's enough of a reason for you to find the right opportunity with the right company, leader, and team. Which leads to my next point…

## 4. Interviews Are a Two-Way Street

You are interviewing the employer just as much as the employer is interviewing you. In fact, I don't like calling them interviews; I call them conversations, because we are both getting to know each other. Understand the hiring manager's style of management, learn how the team works together, how they give/get feedback, how they celebrate wins and losses, etc. Do your research on the company and talk to people that work there (going back to "Leverage your network"). Also, don't be afraid to reject a company if they aren't a right fit.

## 5. Dress for the Job You Want

This may sound old school, but it's better to over-prepare and dress to impress. For me, personally, when I dress up, it prepares me mentally for the type of conversation I want to have. We're in a virtual working environment for the most part now. Interviews are going to be on Zoom/Google Meet/etc., which means you're likely going to be on video. Dress like you're going to an in-person interview. Background doesn't look great? Make sure you test out your background filters on whatever platform the interviewers are using so you're not scrambling at the last minute and you don't end up with someone walking in while you're on video.

## Final Thoughts

I understand that I'm coming from a place of privilege and these tips are not foolproof. I mean, once you get the job, you have to execute and that's a whole other topic for another time. Sometimes it's the little things that will help you get in the right mindset. Hopefully this helps :)
