title: Setting up GitHub Pages

I'm using GitHub Pages to host this blog. I figured others who may want to start writing their own blogs will need some help getting started. There are a lot of tutorials out there, but I wanted to provide something that was quick and easy. After a lot of trial and error, I finally figured out what I needed to do to get this page up and running. You will need, at the very least, a GitHub account.

I found a site that has paid and free [Jekyll Themes for GitHub Pages](https://jekyllthemes.io/github-pages-themes). I used the [Beautiful Jekyll Theme](https://jekyllthemes.io/theme/beautiful-jekyll). This theme is really easy to set up because it comes with simple instructions:
1. Fork the project
2. Rename the repo to `username.github.io` (substiute `username` with your own)
3. Customize your settings in `_config.yml`

There you have it, a website!

The best part about forking this theme is there are a lot of features and options that are available so you don't have to build it from scratch.
